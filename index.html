            "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation 
            and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the 
            charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, 
            that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound 
            to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their
             duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying 
             through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are 
             perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, 
             when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing
             prevents our being able to do what we like best, every 
             pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided.
